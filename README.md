# Power BI Waterfall Chart â€“ Native Visual, Minimal DAX

This project demonstrates how to create a **dynamic, scalable waterfall chart** in Power BI using only **native visuals** and **minimal DAX**, inspired by techniques shared by **Fomi Abdul Mutalib** (Power BI Park). The solution avoids custom visuals and SVG rendering, making it lightweight and easy to maintain.


##  Project Highlights

- âœ… **100% Native Visuals** â€“ No custom visuals or external plugins
- âœ… **Minimal DAX Logic** â€“ Clean and efficient use of `SWITCH(TRUE())`, variables, and calculated measures
- âœ… **Dynamic Scaling** â€“ Adjusts automatically to dataset changes
- âœ… **Conditional Formatting** â€“ Highlights positive/negative deltas clearly
- âœ… **Category Indexing** â€“ Ensures correct ordering and totals
- âœ… **Optimized Labels & Layout** â€“ Improves readability with no text wrapping and formatted headers


##  Why This Matters

Waterfall charts are critical in industries like:

- ðŸ“ˆ **Finance** â€“ Variance analysis, budgeting, forecasting
- ðŸ§¾ **Operations** â€“ Cost breakdowns, performance gaps
- ðŸ’¼ **Business Reviews** â€“ Profit/loss drivers, contribution analysis

This approach is ideal for building **clean, reliable reports** that are:

- Easier to update and scale
- Faster to load and render
- Better aligned with Power BI's performance best practices


## âš™ Built With

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX** for:
  - Conditional calculations
  - Label visibility
  - Delta classification
- **Native Power BI visuals** (Column Chart, Matrix, etc.)



## ðŸ§ª Key Measures Used (DAX)

```DAX
Sales Category =
SWITCH(TRUE(),
    'Data'[Category] = "Increase", "Positive",
    'Data'[Category] = "Decrease", "Negative",
    "Total"
)
```

```DAX
Delta Measure =
VAR Current = SUM('Data'[Amount])
VAR Previous = [Some Previous Logic]
RETURN
    Current - Previous
```

> Full DAX logic is inside the `.pbix` file for detailed reference.
